## 📌 Project Overview

Sugarcane diseases significantly impact yield and crop quality if not detected early. This project uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to automatically classify the **severity level of leaf diseases** using image data.

The model analyzes leaf images and predicts disease severity categories, enabling:
- Faster diagnosis compared to manual inspection  
- Consistent and scalable assessment  
- Potential integration into mobile or field-based applications
